**E-Farm Project**

The E-Farm project is a web platform designed specifically for farmers, aimed at providing them with intuitive tools for efficient management and analysis of agricultural data. Leveraging the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack alongside MaterialUI and Nivo libraries, this platform offers features such as an admin dashboard for streamlined control and data visualization. APIs are utilized to fetch data from MongoDB, empowering farmers with accessible tools for data-driven decision-making. The ultimate goal is to enhance productivity and sustainability in agriculture.
